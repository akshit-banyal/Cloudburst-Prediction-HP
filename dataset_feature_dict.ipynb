    "#### **1. Core Weather Variables (Raw Data)**\n",
    "*Measured daily from satellite/station data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature Name | Full Name | Definition & Significance |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **`PRECTOTCORR`** | **Precipitation Total Corrected** | **Rainfall (mm/day).** The primary driver. A sudden, extreme spike in this value defines the cloudburst event itself. |\n",
    "| **`T2M`** | **Temperature at 2 Meters** | **Air Temperature (°C).** Measured at standard human height. Warmer air has a higher capacity to hold water vapor, creating potential for massive storms. |\n",
    "| **`T2MDEW`** | **Dew Point Temperature** | **Saturation Point (°C).** The temperature at which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. <br> **Key Insight:** If `T2MDEW` is close to `T2M`, the air is holding maximum moisture, a critical precursor to cloudbursts. |\n",
    "| **`RH2M`** | **Relative Humidity** | **Humidity (%).** The percentage of water vapor in the air relative to the maximum it can hold. Cloudbursts typically require near-saturation levels ($>85-90\\%$). |\n",
    "| **`WS10M`** | **Wind Speed at 10 Meters** | **Wind Velocity (m/s).** Measures how fast air is moving. In mountainous regions like Himachal, wind is responsible for **Orographic Lift**—rapidly pushing moisture up slopes to form storm clouds. |\n",
    "| **`PS`** | **Surface Pressure** | **Atmospheric Pressure (kPa).** Low-pressure systems act as a vacuum, drawing in moisture and instability from surrounding areas. Sudden pressure drops often signal approaching storms. |\n",
    "| **`elevation`** | **Elevation** | **Altitude (Meters).** The height of the location above sea level. Topography plays a massive role in where cloudbursts trigger. |\n",

    "| **`DOY`** | **Day of Year (1-365)** | Captures seasonality. Cloudbursts are heavily concentrated in the Monsoon months (roughly DOY 180–240). |\n",
    "| **`YEAR`** | **Calendar Year** | Allows the model to detect long-term climate trends (e.g., increased frequency of events in recent years). |\n",

    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **`_lag_1`** | **Lag Feature** | Value from **1 Day Ago**. (e.g., `PRECTOTCORR_lag_1` is yesterday's rain).<br>*Why:* Wet soil from yesterday's rain makes today's cloudburst more likely to cause flash floods. |\n",
    "| **`_lag_2` / `_3`** | **Lag Feature** | Value from **2 or 3 Days Ago**. Captures the immediate history leading up to the event. |\n",
    "| **`_roll_avg_3`** | **Rolling Mean** | **3-Day Average.** Smoothes out noise to show the trend. <br>*Why:* A single hot day is normal, but a 3-day rising average in Temperature (`T2M_roll_avg_3`) indicates a heatwave building up instability. |\n",
